//        Here is a post on Parse's authentication mechanism: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23820720/parse-com-rest-api-authentication/23823688?noredirect=1#23823688
//        Implementing identifying users and finding friends using phone numbers:
//        http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21414102/how-to-send-the-parse-users-objectid-with-the-twilio-module,
//        https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/sending-messages
//        Basically, here are the steps:
//        1. We ask user to enter his/her phone number (App Store guidelines say we cannot read the phone number from a device,
//              it also says that we can't make emails mandatory – meaning that authentication by email is out of the window,
//              we can't have authenticate only by usernames because 1. it will definitely increase spam, 2. it'll be a pain point
//              to search for a username when you are looking to add people – basically, we don't want people to anything extra to
//              see thair network; when they sign in, they should already have their social network ready)
//        2. We write Cloud Code in Parse as shown here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21414102/how-to-send-the-parse-users-objectid-with-the-twilio-module
//              to connect to Twilio and send a message to the phone number that the user just entered
//        3. This message will have the objectId of the user that Parse will have created
//        4. User then needs to enter that code somewhere in our App's UI
//        5. We then check the database to see if the objectId matched up against the phone number
//        6. If it did, we mark that user as verified      
//        When we combine this with the fact that Parse's REST API doe not ever expire the session token (which any REST API really shouldn't),
//        we now have an app that is "always-on" just like WhatsApp, which also doesn't have a log out option (there is a change number option, which
//        makes sense, and we should implement it as well)
